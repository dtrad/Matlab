function mybigfig(figno)
%BIGFIG enlarges a figure to an optimal size for a slide
% bigfig(figno)
%
% figno is the handle of the figure to be enlarged
% figno defaults to gcf
%
% Normally, BIGFIG enlarges the figure to half the height and half the
% width of your screen. However, you can control this behavior by defining
% some globals BIGFIG_X BIGFIG_Y BIGFIG_WIDTH and BIGFIG_HEIGHT. In order,
% these are the x and y coordiates of the lower left corner and the width
% and height of the figure after enlargement. Specify them in pixels. They
% default to 1,1,screen width and screen height. A good place to define
% them is in your startup.m file. See sample_startup.m in the
% crewes\utilities for an example of a startup file.
