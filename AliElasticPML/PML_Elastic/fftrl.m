function [spec,f]= fftrl(s,t,percent,npad)
% FFTRL: forward Fourier transform for real-valued signals.
%
% [spec,f]= fftrl(s,t,percent,npad)
% [spec,f]= fftrl(s,t,percent)
% [spec,f]= fftrl(s,t)
%
% Forward fourier transform of a real-valued signal. Relative to
% MATLAB's fft it returns only the positive frequencies in an array
% roughly half the size. If there are n input time samples, then there
% will be floor(n/2+1) frequency samples. This means that if n is an even
% number, then a time series of length n and one of length n+1 will produce
% frequency spectra of the same length. However, only the first case will
% have a sample at Nyquist. If the input trace is a vector, then the return
% is simply the transform of that vector. If a matrix, then each 
% column of the matrix is transformed. The inverse is accomplished by
% IFFTRL.
% NOTE: FFTRL, like fft, uses the + sign in the complex Fourier
% exponential, while ifftrl uses the - sign and divides by n.
%
% s= input signal (trace or gather, i.e. vector or matrix or 3D array) 
% t= input time coordinate vector
% percent= specifies the length of a raised cosine taper to be
%          applied to s (both ends) prior to any padding. 
%          Taper is a percent of the length of s. Taper is 
%          applied using MWINDOW.
%		********** Default=0% ***********
% npad= length (in samples) to which the input trace is to be padded with zeros.
%     ********** Default is the input length (no pad) ***********
% NOTE: a value of 0 for npad is taken to mean no pad is desired.
