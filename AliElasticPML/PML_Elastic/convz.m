function s=convz(r,w,nzero,nout,flag)
% CONVZ: convolution then truncation for non-min phase filters
%
% s= convz(r,w,nzero,nout,flag)
% s= convz(r,w,nzero,nout)
% s= convz(r,w,nzero)
% s= convz(r,w)
%
% CONVZ is designed for a convenient convolution of a seismic
% trace with a zero phase (no time delay) wavelet. This can 
% actually be used with any non-causal wavelet by specifying the
% nzero sample which is the sample number of zero time. It
% defaults to the middle of w but can be placed anywhere. 
% If the first input argument is either a row or column vector, then 
% the output will be a similar vector. If the first argument is a matrix,
% then the output is a matrix of similar size where w has been convolved
% with each column of r.
% Uses MATLAB's CONV function.
%
% s= output trace of length nout
% r= input trace (reflectivity)
% w= input wavelet
% nzero= sample number of zero time value for wavelet
%  *********** default=round((length(wavelet)+1)/2)
% nout= length of output trace. 
%   ********** default=length(r)
% flag= 1 --> apply a cosine taper at the beginning and end of the
%            output trace
%     = 0 --> don't apply a taper
%      ********* default= 0 **********
