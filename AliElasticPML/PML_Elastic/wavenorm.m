function wnorm = wavenorm(w,tw,flag)
% WAVENORM: normalize a wavelet
%
% wnorm = wavenorm(w,tw,flag)
%
% WAVENORM normalizes a wavelet by one of several criteria.
% The choices are: (1) normalize the maximum absolut value to unity
% (2) normalize such that a sine wave at the dominant frequency passes
% with unit amplitude (3) normalize the rms amplitude to unity.
%
% w ... input wavelet
% tw ... time coordinate vector for w
% flag ... (1) normalize the maximum absolute value to unity
%          (2) normalize such that a sine wave at the dominant frequency 
%              passes with unit amplitude
%          (3) normalize the rms amplitude to unity
