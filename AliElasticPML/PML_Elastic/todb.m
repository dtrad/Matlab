function Sdb= todb(S,refamp)
% Sdb = todb(S,refamp);
% Sdb = todb(S);
%
% converts a complex spectrum from (real,imaginary) to 
% (decibels,phase angle). Thus if S is a complex spectrum,
% then plot(real(todb(S))) will plot the decibel amplitude
% and plot(imag(todb(S))) will plot the phase spectrum (radians)
%
% S= input complex spectrum
% refamp = input reference amplitude
%           decibels are dbdown from this value. If defaulted,
%           refamp=max(abs(S))
% Sdb= output complex spectrum in the special format:
%       (dbdown, phase angle)
% 
% the INVERSE of this process is the function FROMDB found in
% the seismic toolbox
