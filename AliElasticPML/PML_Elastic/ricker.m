function [wavelet,tw]=ricker(dt,fdom,tlength)
% RICKER: creates a Ricker wavelet
%
% [wavelet,tw]=ricker(dt,fdom,tlength)
% [wavelet,tw]=ricker(dt,fdom) 
% [wavelet,tw]=ricker(dt) 
% 
% RICKER returns a Ricker wavelet.
%
% dt= desired temporal sample rate in seconds
% fdom= dominant frequency in Hz (default: 15 Hz)
% tlength= wavelet length in seconds (default: 127*dt 
%                                     (ie a power of 2))
% 
% The wavelet is generated from an analog expression for a 
% Ricker wavelet and then normalized. The normalization is such that a
% sinusoid of the dominant frequency is passed with unit amplitude (see
% wavenorm.m)
